From basic extension methods to complete implementations of design patterns, Mauve offers a colorful suite of functionality for utilization in even the grandest applications.

## Features
The following features are available for use through Mauve:

|Feature|Description|
|-|-|
|Serialization|Mauve contains two extension methods for out of the box serialization support using `T.Serialize(SerializationMethod)` and `string.Deserialize(SerializationMethod)`. There is currently support for raw, binary, XML, JSON, and YAML serialization methods.|
|Cryptography|Mauve aims to simplify cryptography implementations for consumers.|
|Validation|Validation should be simple, concise, and encapsulated.|

There are many more features available in the framework of course, but the above are easily the most popular. For more information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Mauve/wiki).

## Extension Methods
Mauve offers a variety of useful extension methods for the most common data types in the `C#` language:

 - `int`
 - `string`
 - `DateTime`
 - `Queue`
 - `Type`
 - `Exception`
 - `IComparable`
 - `IEnumerable<T>`

 Additionally, there are a few extension methods using generics for type safety that apply to all types.
